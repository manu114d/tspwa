        <p class="p1">
            Bonalu is a festival of offering to the Mother Goddess and families share the offering with family members and guests. A non-vegetarian family feast follows after the great the offering. The meat used to prepare the meal is the meat of a goat or a chicken which is an animal for which blessing is taking, killed and later consumed as meal. Peasants take whatever food they can as a display of affection to the earth goddess and eat it later. Toddy workers also offer toddy which they tap for their lively hood. There is no special scriptural mandate on what has to be offered. The tradition is The offerings are made to goddess most importantly toddy - Palm Tree wine is offered along with fowls, sheep and goat. Animals killed for community meals are not considered sacrifices. here are no scriptural books for peasant tradition mother goddess deities requesting meat as offering. The tradition is a peasant festival tradition like the Islamic Bakrid tradition where goat is killed and consumed. Western and Brahmin literature confuses animals consumed in festival time for communal meals in peasant tradition with the sacrifices of Rig Vedic Brahmins where animals were killed by fire priests not for consumption but for ritual reasons. Rig Veda. However with the advent of modernization and strict government control over the prevention of peasant traditions has restricted people to use only pumpkins, bottle gourds, coconuts and lemons. The tradition of community meals associated with peasant traditions was conflated with Rig Vedic system.
            
            The festival environment is quite palpable in the locality celebrating the festival, with loud-speakers playing Mother Goddess songs in folk style, and streets are decorated with neem leaves.

            The history of the origin of this festival traces back to the 18th Century the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. In the year 1813, plague disease broke out in
            the twin cities, and this took away the lives of thousands of people. Just
            before this, a military battalion from Hyderabad was deployed to Ujjain.
            When this Hyderabadian Military Battalion got to know about the epidemic in
            the cities, they prayed to the Mother Goddess in Mahankaal Temple
            - Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. History tells us, that this military battalion
            prayed to Goddess Mahankaali, to kill the plague, and if the Goddess would
            do so, they had decided to install an idol of the Goddess Mahankaali in the
            city. It is believed that Mahankaali destroyed the disease and kept the
            pestilence away. Then, the military battalion returned to the city and
            installed an idol of the goddess, which was followed by the offering
            of Bonalu to her. Hence, from then, this became a tradition, which has been
            followed and is still being followed by most of the people of Telangana.
